      Hi there! My name is Alexander Achcar. I&#39;m a passionate lifelong learner when it comes to all things 
      technology â€” currently most interested in the intersection of technology with finance, stemming from 
      my current job as a Software Analyst at Citibank. I spent my first 12 months at Citi working on a team 
      focused on developing and iterating on a bond pricing application. My current team primarily implements 
      financial controls for a subset of Citibank traders. I&#39;ve been in this role since July 2022, which is 
      when I transitioned into my career from McGill University. At McGill I found a deep interest for 
      learning about new technologies while also pursuing more general curiosities in Neuroscience through my 
      minor.

      I put together this website as a means to become familiar with a modern frontend tech stack and give a 
      small introduction to me as a person. Please feel free to reach out through LinkedIn or email via the
